This project was created as a gimmicky discord bot for me and my friends. It used playwright to brute force through the login process and send a tweet prompting grok, and screenshotting grok's response afterward. It worked at one point, but I now realize that maintenance for this thing is a waste (Since it will break with essentially any changes to X's UI).

This was a very naive attempt at bypassing X's ridiculous API costs. Now I know better!
